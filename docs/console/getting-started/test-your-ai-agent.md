# Test Your AI Agent

Before going live, it's important to thoroughly test your AI agent to ensure it provides accurate and helpful responses.

## Testing Methods

### 1. Direct Chat Testing
1. Use the built-in chat interface in the Supportium Console
2. Try various questions your customers might ask
3. Check the accuracy and tone of responses

### 2. Test Scenarios
- Common customer inquiries
- Complex or multi-part questions
- Questions outside the knowledge base
- Edge cases and unusual requests

## Evaluating Responses

When testing, consider:

- **Accuracy**: Are the answers correct and relevant?
- **Tone**: Does the response match your brand voice?
- **Completeness**: Does it fully answer the question?
- **Helpfulness**: Is the response actually useful to the customer?

## Making Adjustments

1. For incorrect answers:
   - Add the correct information to your knowledge base
   - Create specific Q&A pairs
   
2. For tone issues:
   - Adjust the personality settings
   - Add style guidelines to your knowledge base
