# Will it make things up?

"Hallucinations" i.e. making things up is a big problem with AI, but you don't have to worry about it with AskAI.

AskAI uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT to answer your questions, based on the content that’s similar to your question.

By default we set AskAI up so it will only answer questions based on the content you upload, it will not answer any questions where the answer is not contained within the content. This is why you sometimes get an "I'm sorry, I don't know" answer.

This is for 2 reasons:

  1. If it had ‘wider’ ChatGPT knowledge then there would be no way to verify the accuracy of the responses

  2. If it did have this ability then users of your AskAI would essentially just have a free way to access ChatGPT through your AskAI!

While we train our model to ensure your AskAI only answers questions truthfully and in a factually accurate manner, however, no service is 100% accurate and we (or anyone else) are unable to make it so and so we do not take any responsibility for the consequences of actions you take based on the results you get from your AskAI, you use the responses at your own risk.
