# Temperature

AI "Temperature" controls the variability of your answers when asked the same question, here's why we don't recommend changing it.

### 

Can I change the temperature of the model?

You canâ€™t change the temperature of the model. 

Our temperatures are set to 0 to ensure you get a consistent response each time you use your AI support agent. 

Increasing temperature increases the variability of your responses i.e. if you ask the same question twice you will get 2 different answers.
