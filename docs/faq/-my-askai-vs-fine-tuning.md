## Supportium AI vs Fine-tuning

Supportium AI's support agent is built using "embeddings" rather than "fine-tuning".

### 

**Is this fine-tuning? Whatâ€™s the difference?**

Not quite. Fine-tuning is most effective when you have a large dataset in a prompt (input) and completion (output) format, and you want to generate similar outputs from new inputs. It requires structured and curated data for best results.

Supportium AI uses 'embeddings', which allows you to upload your content and start querying without needing to pre-format your data. This makes it easier and faster to deploy knowledge-based AI support.
