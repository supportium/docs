# Will it answer questions about competitors' products?

Your AskAI is specifically controlled so it doesn't have any external information to answer questions.

The only way it will be able to answer questions about your competitor's products is if you have a comparison page or similar on your site, otherwise, no, it won't answer questions about your competitor's products, the user will simply get an "I don't know" response.
