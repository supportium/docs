Which model or (Large Language Model) LLM does Supportium AI use?

Supportium AI uses a variety of models to provide the highest quality AI agent responses.

There is no single model used, there are a combination of smaller, faster models for certain parts of the answering process, combined with more powerful or fine-tuned models for final responses.

These models are continually being re-evaluated, benchmarked and A/B tested to improve overall AI resolution for our users.

We predominantly use OpenAI models (generally whichever is the latest model at time of writing), however for certain tasks we may use Google or Anthropic models where performance is superior.

We don't currently use any reasoning models (such as O1 or O3 due to the slow speed at which they operate).
