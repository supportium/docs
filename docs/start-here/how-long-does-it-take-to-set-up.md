# How long does it take to set-up?

You can have your AI customer support agent set-up on your website in a matter of minutes.

In terms of "hands-on" time, it takes less than 2 minutes to set up. 

You will however have to wait for us to find all of your site's web pages, which can take a bit longer and is dependent on the size of your sites.

An average-sized site will take approximately 30 minutes (but can take up to an hour for websites with 500+ webpages).
