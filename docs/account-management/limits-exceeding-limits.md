# Exceeding limits

Find out what happens when you go over your conversation limit within a month on your AI support agent.

### 

What happens if I go over or exceed my monthly conversation quota, limit or allowance?

#### 

Essentials Plan

If you are on an Essentials plan, then your AI agent will display a message saying that it is unavailable and that the user should choose the "Talk to a person" option.

You can then choose to either upgrade to a Pro plan or wait until the quote resets at the start of the next billing cycle.

#### 

Pro Plan

If you are on a Pro plan, then you have "Flex" turned pricing turned on (this cannot be turned off). 

Flex allows your AI agent to continue responding when you go beyond your conversation limits, each conversation beyond your account limit is charged at $0.10 and is charged in the next month's invoice or on cancellation.

### 

Can I disable Flex?

You cannot disable flex pricing.

### 

Can I limit the number of conversations asked by employees?

There are no ways to currently limit conversations from employees, if this is an issue for you, please contact us via chat.
