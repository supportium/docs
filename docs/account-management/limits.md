# Account Limits

Learn about the limitations of your AI support agent (there are very few!)

## Token Limits

You don't need to worry about token limits. There are no training content limits in terms of pages or words on any of our paid plans.

## Conversation Limits

Conversation limits are at an overall account level, meaning they are counted across all conversations with the AI agent, not per visitor.

| Plan | Number of Conversations |
|------|-------------------------|
| Essentials | 200 |
| Pro | 1,000 + $0.10 per conversation beyond limit |
| Enterprise | Contact sales for custom limits |

## Question Character Limits

Your questions can be up to 400 characters in length.
