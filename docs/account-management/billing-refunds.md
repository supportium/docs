# Refunds

Learn more about how you can get your money back if you are unhappy with Supportium AI.

As we offer a 30-day free trial of our paid plans, we do not generally offer refunds.

Refunds will be given to users who request them within the EU or UK within 14 days of the first purchase (not future invoices) and in other cases on a discretionary basis.

Refunds will be net of any fees incurred.

Contact us via chat if you believe you are entitled to a refund.
