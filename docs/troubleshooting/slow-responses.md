# Slow responses

You can generally expect response times from Supportium AI to be just a few seconds however there are rare occasions when this is not the case.

Response times can vary based on OpenAIâ€™s API response times and also by the size of the answer being returned. The longer and more detailed the answer being given the longer it will take to produce. 

Finally, answer speeds are always improving with the pace of AI development, so if they aren't quick enough now, give it a month or 2!
