Why can’t my AI agent access or add my website?

The main reasons we see for bots not being able to access or add websites is if they are either behind password protection or if they have some sort of technology to prevent them from being scraped. 

If you are sure it isn’t one of these things then get in touch via chat and we’ll help you get your content uploaded.

###
