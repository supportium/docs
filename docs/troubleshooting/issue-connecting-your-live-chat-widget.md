# Issue connecting your live chat widget

Here we cover common questions and fixes for issues connecting your live chat provider (excluding Intercom, HubSpot and Zendesk), to your AI agent using our human handover feature.

## 

Why don't I have to provide any login credentials for my chat provider?

We don't need your live chat (except for Intercom, Hubspot and Zendesk) credentials for our 'Human Handover' integration. 

What happens is, we hide your existing chat widget on your site (once you've added your AI support agent). Then, if someone wants to speak to your team, they select "Speak to a person" and we show your chat widget and hide your AI support agent.

If you go into your Dashboard (for your new AI support agent) then you can see this in action.
